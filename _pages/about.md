I am a PhD candidate and Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Fellow at the [Department of Metorology](https://www.su.se/department-of-meteorology/) at Stockholm University, working with Professor Annica Ekman.

My [research](https://mauradewey.github.io/research) is on aerosol-cloud-climate interactions, global climate modelling and emulation, and applications of machine learning to atmospheric science. I am especially interested in regional and near-term climate change and impacts, and science communication. 

In addition to my academic work, I also spend a lot of time [around boats](https://mauradewey.github.io/sailing), both as a competitve sailor and professional meteorologist.
